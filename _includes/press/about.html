                    <h4>History</h4>
                    <p>
                        <b>Piperift</b> was founded in March 2016 by Miguel Fernandez, <br>after he decided to start developing MrBrian, a first person stealth game.
                        He teamed up with more developers and worked for six months on the prototype, without any resources, space or money.
                        <br><br>
                        They wanted to create something new, 
                        that's why they decided to pause Mr.Brian and commit to finishing a game from zero in just one month. <b>Etereo</b> 
                        <br>This gave us the opportunity to work with new people and discover more about ourselves.
                        But more importantly we had a finished game!
                        <br><br>
                        After <b>Etereo</b> they started working on another great project called <br><b>Before you Die</b>, a 3D fast-paced roguelike shooter.
                        <br>This time the development continued for 3 months,
                        allowing them to evolve even more as professionals and providing them with new tools and resources to add to <b>Mr.Brian</b>

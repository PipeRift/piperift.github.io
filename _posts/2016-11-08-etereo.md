We are back with some news!

Today we proudly present Etereo, a small adventure-platformer game we have been working on for one month.

<!--end-preview-->
In Etereo you will help a child in his adventure, exorcizing the corrupted forest dwellers and destroying the darkness dispensers to finally seal the evil again in the depths.

Etereo came up as an experiment of creating a game in one month.
At PipeRift we wanted to create something new, that's why we decided to create a game from zero in this time. This gave us the opportunity to work with new people and discover more about us.

If you decide to play it, we will love to receive your honest feedback!

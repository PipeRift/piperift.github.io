# About

**Piperift** was founded in **2015** with the dream of developing ground-breaking game technology (and videogames that use it!).

What originally started as tiny games in university, evolved into creating technology that, for more than 10 years, **helps people make games**, from Indie games to AAA.
This is often achieved through [open-source](https://github.com/piperift) and public research of a multitude of topics.
